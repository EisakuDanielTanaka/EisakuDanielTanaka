# Hello!
I'm Eisaku, a data scientist intern at [Manzanita](https://www.mnzt.io/en/) and data science research assistant.
This only shows a small portion of projects that I have done, as my ML and NLP projects from work cannot be shown here. 

The major ML and NLP projects that I have been involved in were:
* Language modeling in English and Japanese to commercially proudce psycholinguistic understanding.
* Research publication co-author for critically assessing psycholinguistic tools for Japanese NLP - the preprint will soon be available.
* Ongoing: Co-authoring a research publication for fine-tuning psycholinguistic tools for NLU in Japan.

Please feel free to contact me via email to ask me about these projects.
