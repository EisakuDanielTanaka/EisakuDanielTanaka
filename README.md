# Hello!
I'm Eisaku, a data scientist at [Manzanita](https://www.mnzt.io/en/) and a research assistant to the University of Cambridge's People Analytics Lead Researcher, Peter Romero. I graduated Keio University in 2021 with a degree in Economics and an emphasis in Computer Science. My work overaches the fields of machine learning, deep learning, and computational psycholinguistics.
This only shows a small portion of projects that I have done, as my ML and NLP projects from work cannot be shown here. 

Major programming projects that are pinned include:
* An AI that solves a Peg-Solitaire Game (C language).
* K-nearest neighbors and range search algorithm implementation (C language).
* Graphic simulation utilizing advanced object oriented concepts (Java).
* LDA Topic Modeling of Japanese News Corpus (Python).

The major ML and NLP projects that I have been involved in were:
* Psycholinguistic language modeling in English and Japanese for commercial NLU.
* Analyzed psycholinguistic properties, collocations, and classifications of topics in social media data.
* Research publication co-author for an interdisciplinary research of Geographic Psychology and Psycholinguistics utilizing machine learning methods. 
* Ongoing: Co-authoring a research publication for fine-tuning psycholinguistic tools for NLU in Japan.

Please feel free to contact me via email to ask me about these projects.
