# Hello!
I'm Eisaku, a data scientist intern at [Manzanita](https://www.mnzt.io/en/) and data science research assistant.
This only shows a small portion of projects that I have done, as my ML and NLP projects from work cannot be shown here. 

The major ML and NLP projects that I have been involved in were:
* Psycholinguistic language modeling in English and Japanese for commercial NLU.
* Research publication co-author for an interdisciplinary research of Geographic Psychology and Psycholinguistics utilizing machine learning methods. 
* Ongoing: Co-authoring a research publication for fine-tuning psycholinguistic tools for NLU in Japan.

Please feel free to contact me via email to ask me about these projects.
